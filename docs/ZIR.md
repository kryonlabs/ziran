# Ziran intermediate representation (`.zir`)

This is the target contract. An experimental binary version 28 now exists for
the tested C/C++/Go and portable scalar/record/enum subsets. It is not yet the complete contract below; see
[Implementation status](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md).

`.zir` is a versioned, checked, serializable module representation. It is the
shared input to native backends and the portable linker. It records module and
symbol identities, imports/exports, resolved types, constants, function
bodies, control flow, source locations, declared FFI, and host capability
requirements. Backends may attach target-specific output metadata outside the
language model, but they must not reinterpret source text to recover program
meaning.

The Ziran compiler provides a canonical writer and a validating reader. The
reader rejects unknown incompatible versions, truncated or malformed data,
invalid symbol references, and invalid types with useful diagnostics. The
writer produces deterministic bytes for equivalent checked modules. A backend
given saved `.zir` has the same language semantics as one given the `.zi`
source that produced it. Diagnostics retain source paths and spans where
available.

The IR represents general calls, records, slots, imports, and capabilities.
It has no widget kind, `#ui` flag, DOM attribute cache, KSS node, or implicit
Kryon module. A Kryon widget call has the same representation as a call to an
unrelated imported function with the same type shape.

`.zir` is the compiler interchange and cache format. Portable distribution
uses a linked `.zib`, not an unlinked `.zir`. See [Bundle format](ZIB.md).

## Experimental version 28

The current writer emits `ZIR` followed by a zero byte, a little-endian
version number, and length-prefixed checked module records. Strings and
integers are encoded explicitly; process pointers and C struct padding are
not serialized. The reader rejects wrong versions, truncated records,
oversized fields, invalid references, and trailing bytes. The C, C++, and native Go
commands can build saved `.zir` modules, including an imported two-module
typed record call example. The experimental `.zib` bundler also consumes saved `.zir`
for its restricted scalar, record, and enum subset. Native and bundle builds rerun
the language checker on the saved expression graph. The reader rejects invalid
references and cycles, and the checked serialization must match the saved bytes.
Every build uses strict checking, including native builds from source.
Checking is unconditional; `--strict` and `--no-strict` are rejected.
Call argument expressions retain source order and store their source name and
checked parameter index. Native emitters and the portable VM evaluate in source
order, then pass values in parameter order. Procedure declarations retain their
default expressions; omitted arguments are materialized as checked call
expressions before serialization. Concrete defaults use checked procedures in
the declaring module so their names keep that module's scope.
For checked functions, statement text is source metadata; the expression graph
and explicit branch flags and loop target IDs determine behavior. The checker
requires each named loop exit to point to a unique enclosing loop. Exhaustive
enum `if #complete value == { ... }` is lowered to typed branches and an
`unreachable` guard before writing IR, so saved modules contain no case selection
statement to reinterpret. Source `variant`, payload `match`, postfix `?`,
`guard`, C-style `switch` and `goto` with labels, `state` blocks, C-style
locals, and raw C statements are rejected. The validating reader rejects
retired statement kinds. The postfix increment/decrement expression kind has
been removed; version 28 rejects earlier files before graph validation.
Variant fields, generated variant function slots,
retained-state fields, and unused statement callee/argument text are absent
from the IR schema.
Generic record templates retain their parameter and field declarations. Explicit
specializations are stored as ordinary concrete types.
Union types preserve their shared-storage flag. C and C++ use that flag for
native declarations; Go and the portable linker currently reject union storage.
Polymorphic procedures retain their `$T` signature and structured body.
Concrete call specializations carry their type and generated identity; imported
saved modules can instantiate them when a source caller uses a new type.
Specialized `Vec(T)` records carry an owned-storage bit. The reader validates
their storage shape before allowing vector operations.
Compile-time `#if` selection is complete in the frontend. Saved declarations
carry no C preprocessor guard, and `#assert` failures are diagnosed before
native or portable output.
Type and constant records preserve export and file-private visibility for
imported-name and loaded-file checking.
Native function bodies use checked statement and expression graphs; statement
text remains diagnostic metadata. Version 27 is experimental and has no
compatibility promise.
Expression records preserve whether `#this` selected the enclosing procedure,
so checking saved IR keeps that binding even when a parameter has the same name.
